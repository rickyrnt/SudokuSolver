findTuples pseudocode:

Call a checkNum/checkNumSect on the number to make sure it isn't a loner (this will replace the call to those functions)
Start at the number of squares a given number occupies and go up to 8
x is the current degree of ther proposed tuple
Start with the squares occupied by the starting number
Add to those squares the squares occupied by a number that intersects the current proposed tuple
Do not add squares if they would go over x
If it doesn't work try the next intersection (dfs recursive)
If a tuple is found, check it to see if any smaller tuples are within it
Remove any numbers not in the tuple
